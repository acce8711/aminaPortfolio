            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>This project was completed as a final group project for a web 
                development course. EZ PZ is a unit converter developed using
                 HTML/CSS and Javascript and made for basic and  quick conversions.
                  It has six different conversion categories and is for anyone who 
                  needs a quick and simple conversion.</p>

            <h3>WIREFRAMES/MOCKUPS</h3>
            <h2>Exploring the layout</h2>
            <p>We created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop version of the 
                website. The basic layout consisted of a home page and a page for 
                each converter. All of the converters would be visible on the 
                homepage. A navigation bar, containing all of the converter was 
                placed on each converter page to allow for easy navigation</p>
            <img src="images/placehodler.jpg" alt="placeholder img">   
            <p>Several mockups were made to explore the different colour palettes.
                 We settled on  two colour palettes, a dark mode and a light mode 
                 which helped us with the accessibility aspect of our design.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p><strong>Learned how to use GitHub.</strong> One of my group members introduced me to Github.
                     I learned that it can be quite a powerful tool that helps with the efficiency 
                     and collaboration in the development stage.</p>
                <p><strong>Became familiar with the design to development process.</strong> Our group faced several 
                    challenges when transitioning from the design phase in tot the development. 
                    By facing those challenges, I learned what needs to be done in the design phase to help with 
                    the development phase</p>
                <p> <strong>Solved development challenges.</strong> I had trouble implementing the dark mode/light mode.
                     What helped me was creating a separate html file and implementing it there before doing so on our website.</p>
                <p><strong>Focused on accessibility.</strong> Conducting secondary research and following guidelines 
                    helped make design decisions that improved the accessibility of our website.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p><strong>Implement user feedback.</strong>
                    We were able to collect some user feedback but due to the time constraint of the project we did not
                     have enough time to implement it.</p>
